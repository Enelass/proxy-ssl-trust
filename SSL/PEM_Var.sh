#  DESCRIPTION: The purpose of this script is to provide various CLI on MacOS with #
#                a custom PEM certificate store including public and internal Root #
#                certificate authorities. This will resolve number of connectivity #
#                issues where CLI not relying on the MacOS Keychain Access can     #
#                still trust internally signed servers using an Internal Root CA   #
#                and trust https connections where SSL forward inspection is       #
#                performed and signed on a fly by a proxy/ngfw internal CA.        #
